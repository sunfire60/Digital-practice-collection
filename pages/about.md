# About {{ site.title }}

This is my first digital site that I created using the combined resources of the symposium team after we learned how to scan and edit our documents.

### Technical

This website was created by UI Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) using the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
The basic frame work is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
Metadata visualizations are created using [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) and [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/).
Document metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
